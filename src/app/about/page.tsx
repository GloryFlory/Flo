                At my core, I'm someone who loves to grow, connect, and share. Whether it's through my podcast, retreats, creative projects, or simply the conversations I have with people, my deepest motivation is to support others on their journey‚Äîhelping them feel seen, inspired, and more connected to themselves and those around them.

                What drives me is the belief that growth doesn't have to be lonely. When we show up with openness and vulnerability, we create spaces where real transformation can happen. Following my heart has led me onto a path that isn't always the easiest or most secure, but it's the one that feels true.

              <p>
                I spent years working in the corporate world, specializing in compliance and finance. While it gave me stability, I realized it wasn't aligned with my deeper purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2023, I stepped away to follow my heart‚Äîtraveling across Asia, immersing myself in new cultures, and dedicating myself to self-discovery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the way, I trained as a Yoga Teacher in Bali, became a Thai Massage Practitioner in Chiang Mai, and explored countless practices in mindfulness, embodiment, and personal growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                I co-organize the Mediterranean Acro Convention (MAC), bringing together people from all over the world to share movement, connection, and community.
              </p>
              <p>
                I launched the Grow with the Flo Podcast, a space for honest conversations about growth, vulnerability, and living a life true to yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, because I love experimenting, I've dipped my toes into climbing, padel, improv comedy, Acroyoga, and more‚Äîembracing the idea of being a curious "jack of all trades."
